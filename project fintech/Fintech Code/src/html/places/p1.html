            <p class="about-content">Shinde Chhatri (Marathi : शिंदे छत्री) at Wanawadi in Pune, India is a memorial dedicated to the 18th century Maratha military leader Mahadji Shinde who served as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army under the Peshwas from 1760 to 1780. It is one of the most significant landmarks in he city and is reminiscent of the Maratha rule. It is a hall that marks the spot of Mahadji Shinde's cremation on 12 February 1794. In 1794, the complex of the memorial only had a temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, which was built by Mahadji Shinde himself. He died the same year and his last rites were performed in the premises. The memorial to Mahadji was commissioned by one of his descendents.

                In 1910, a samadhi (memorial) was constructed outside the sanctum of the Shiva temple, in memory of Mahadji Shinde, exactly where he was cremated. Maharaja Madho Rao Scindia of Gwalior (1876 – 1925) commissioned the building of the complex, along with the memorial of Mahadji Shinde.The Architects of the monument were the firm of Shapurjee N. Chandabhoy of Bombay.</p>
