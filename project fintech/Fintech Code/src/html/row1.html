            <p class="about-content">A blog on city restaurants cannot go by without including Vaishali, one of the best veg restaurants in Pune. The place is a legend when it comes to serving authentic South Indian food that transports you instantly to the land of idli-sambar. Vaishali defies all logic when it comes to peak hour rush, as more often than not, you are likely to find a huge waiting line at the restaurant, even at 7 in the morning. For a Punekar, the place is a food Mecca and for the vast student community of the city, it is godâ€™s gift.  This decades-old restaurant has its own fan following, which swears by the taste and authenticity of its food.

                Nothing much has changed about this place in all these years; the food served as tasty as ever, the staff courteous, and the waiting list still serpentine at all times of the day. The lucky ones might even get to share a table with famous celebrities at times! maybe you like food truck in Pune</p>
