            <p class="about-content">One of the best restaurants in Pune for dinner with your partner, Malaka Spice is sure to give you a great evening. The place is known for the creativity unleashed on the plates by their chef. With their Pan-Asian menu being reinvented every season, you will find an amazing array of fusion dishes from Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Burma. Malaka Spice is located at three locations in Pune, all three of which are a favorite of locals. Not only are the dishes innovative, but their names are also quite intriguing. All the dishes on the menu are classified into either of the two categories; ‘A Chef Cheeru Original’ and ‘Inspired not Imitated’. You can select your sinful delight from the street food section or the Asian fusion section, both being equally exotic.</p>
