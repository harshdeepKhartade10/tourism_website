            <p class="about-content">The Punekars swear by this cafe and those from overseas also throng it from morning to night. Off-late, the interiors of the good old bakery have been refurbished, but the essence of the place has stayed intact even after so many years of it serving lip-smacking delicacies. Leaving the bakery without getting their out-of-the-world Shrewsbury Biscuits packed, is almost considered a blasphemy in Pune. It is always full and you can spend the waiting time ogling at the sumptuous cakes and biscuits in the glass cabinets. German Bakery is almost a heritage spot for Punekars and it has continued to be their favorite. There is outdoor seating on the ground floor while the first floor of the bakery has indoor seating. The staff is courteous, the service is efficient and quick, and the food is heavenly.</p>
