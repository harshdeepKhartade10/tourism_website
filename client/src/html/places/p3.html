            <p class="about-content">The construction of the synagogue started in 1863 by philanthropist David Sassoon and was then completed by his successors in 1867.The synagogue was designed by Henry Saint Clair Wilkins and was an example of English Gothic architecture. The churchlike building was constructed with red brick and trap rock and has a 90-foot tall obelisk with a clock brought especially from London.[3] One of the largest synagogues built in India, Ohel David (Hebrew for Tent of David), constructed from 1863 to 1867, is located on a prominent site on Moledina Road near M. G. and Ambedkar Roads. This area came to be known as Pune Camp (or Cantonment), a military district established in 1918 to accommodate troops of the British Indian Army. For years the landmark synagogue, which has ably served the city's Baghdadi-Jewish community for about a century-and-a-half, has been known locally as Laal Deul (Red Temple). "Laal" is the Marathi word for "Red" as a reference to the brilliant color of the building's exterior brick. "Deul" is the Marathi word for "Temple". The construction of the synagogue and its endowment were made possible by David Sassoon, patriarch of the great Sassoon dynasty that made its mark in trading, commerce, and shipping in India and the East during the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The Sassoons funded the construction of many other religious, civic, and institutional buildings in the city and elsewhere in India, including Pune's Sassoon Hospital and Mumbai's Baghdadi synagogues Knesset Eliyahoo and Magen David Synagogue (Byculla).</p>
