            <p class="about-content">Situated at the height of 3400 feet, Lohagad Fort is a UNESCO world heritage site and formidable fort about 52 kilometres away from Pune. Perched atop an impressive hill near Malavali, this destination is the perfect amalgam of ancient architecture and natural beauty. Lohagad Fort was built in the 18th century and is an ideal destination forb trekking and nature lovers, especially from Pune and Mumbai. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj used to keep his treasury in this fort.

                The trek to the fort is an easy one and perfect for the first-timers, making it a favourite haunt of hiking enthusiasts. In addition to its thrilling trek route, Lohagad Fort in itself is a massive structure that was once under the control of the mighty Maratha Empire and is connected to its twin Visapur Fort as well. Until a few years back, the base of the fort was quite far from the last point connected via road, but now a proper road has been built to the base of the fort, due to which a lot of people visit Lohagad during monsoon weekends, making it quite crowded. Whether you visit this destination for its lush green beauty, adventurous trekking route, panoramic views or illustrious history, Lohagad Fort is certainly worthy of a visit.</p>
