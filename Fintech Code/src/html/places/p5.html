            <p class="about-content">Vishrambaag Wada, a fine mansion situated at central Pune's Thorale Bajirao Road, was the luxurious residence of Peshwa Baji Rao II, the last Peshwa of Maratha confederacy, in early 19th century. The 20,000 sq.ft. wada presently houses a post office on its ground floor, a few other offices of the municipal corporation and a small museum of Maratha artifacts put together by noted Maratha historian, Babasaheb Purandare. This structure is famous for its fine entrance and the balcony with carved woodwork.Vishrambaug Wada was built in 1807 AD at the price of Rs 200,000. It took six years to complete the construction.Baji Rao II preferred this residence to the ill-fated Shaniwar Wada, the citadel of the Peshwas. Baji Rao II stayed here for eleven years until his defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. After the war the British exiled him with a pension to Bithur near Kanpur. His wife, Varanasibai, continued to stay here for a while before joining him in Bithur. Soon the British took over Pune.

                In 1821, the new East India Company rulers of Pune started the Hindoo college in the Wada to continue Sanskrit learning in the city. The college was the forerunner of the Poona college which later became Deccan College. A high school called Vishrambag High School also operated out of the palace. In 1871, an act of arson entirely destroyed the eastern wing of the wada.</p>
